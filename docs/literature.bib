In the course of numerous UAV-based remote sensing campaigns significant numbers of airborne photographs of two different landslides have been acquired. These images were used for ortho-mosaic and digital terrain model (DTM) generation, thus allowing for high-resolution landslide monitoring.

Assisted flights were performed within two research plots established in mature pure Norway spruce (Picea abies (L.) H. Karst.) and European beech (Fagus sylvatica L.) forest stands. Geotagged images were used to produce georeferenced 3D point clouds representing tree stem surfaces. With a flight height of 8 m above the ground, the stems were precisely modeled up to a height of 10 m, which represents a considerably larger portion of the stem when compared with terrestrial close-range photogrammetry. Accuracy of the point clouds was evaluated by comparing field-measured tree diameters at breast height (DBH) with diameter estimates derived from the point cloud using four different fitting methods, including the bounding circle, convex hull, least squares circle, and least squares ellipse methods. The accuracy of DBH estimation varied with the UAS model and the diameter fitting method utilized. With the Phantom 4 Pro and the least squares ellipse method to estimate diameter, the mean error of diameter estimates was −1.17 cm (−3.14\%) and 0.27 cm (0.69\%) for spruce and beech stands, respectively.},

This study investigates the potential of the DJI Phantom 4 Pro 3D point clouds and derived crown surface height information in combination with RGB spectral information for mapping of deciduous tree species in the Hainich national park area. RGB image data was captured in August, early October and November 2018 to create a multi seasonal spectral dataset for a 100\&amp;thinsp;ha test area. The flight campaigns were controlled from the Hainich flux tower platform in 40\&amp;thinsp;m height owned and operated by University of Göttingen in the central part of the park area. Absolut georeferencing accuracy of the datasets was improved using 7 DGPS measured control points within the stand structure on small forest clearings. Image files and ground control points were processed to a dense point cloud model with 2.6 billion points (approximately 200k points per tree crown object) using the Agisoft Metashape cluster processing environment. Additionally, a digital surface model and a true ortho image mosaic with 3\&amp;thinsp;cm spatial resolution was generated. For the differentiation of deciduous tree species, a reference data set with coordinates for the tree species \textit{Fagus sylvatica} (beech), \textit{Fraxinus excelsior} (ash), \textit{Acer pseudoplatanus} (sycamore maple), \textit{Carpinus betulus} (hornbeam) and dead trees and early defoliated trees was defined. The study site is however dominated by Fagus sylvatica and Fraxinus excelsior. We studied two different groups of features: tree crown surface height variability parameters using point cloud densities, point cloud height variance, local standard deviation of gaussian curvature, standard deviation of local point cloud roughness and multi temporal normalised spectral features using multi seasonal uncalibrated UAV RGB data. Analysis of feature separability showed that very high-resolution point cloud surface curvature properties with small neighbourhood radii can differentiate some tree species types but we also found multitemporal spectral ratios based on RGB data to be very successful in differentiating the main tree species.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}{\textless}p{\textgreater}Results of this work show that super fine very dense point cloud models and derived roughness measures of mixed forest stand surfaces hold valuable information for deciduous species discrimination and will likely also be very useful for morphological analysis of tree crown types.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {Understorey vegetation plays an important role in many ecosystems, yet identifying and monitoring understorey vegetation through remote sensing has proved a challenge for researchers and land managers because understorey plants tend to be small, spatially and spectrally similar, and are often blocked by the overstorey. The emergence of Unmanned Aerial Systems (UAS) is revolutionising how vegetation is measured, and may allow us to measure understorey species where traditional remote sensing previously could not. The goal of this paper was to review current literature and assess the current capability of UAS to identify and monitor understorey vegetation. From the literature, we focused on the technical attributes that limit the ability to monitor understorey vegetation—specifically (1) spatial resolution, (2) spectral sensitivity, (3) spatial extent, and (4) temporal frequency at which a sensor acquires data. We found that UAS have provided improved levels of spatial resolution, with authors reporting successful classifications of understorey vegetation at resolutions of between 3 mm and 200 mm. Species discrimination can be achieved by targeting flights to correspond with phenological events to allow the detection of species-specific differences. We provide recommendations as to how UAS attributes can be tailored to help identify and monitor understorey species.},

In this study, we propose a comprehensive workﬂow to detect trees and assess forest attributes in the particular context of coniferous stands in transformation from even-aged to uneven-aged stands, using UAS imagery, from data acquisition to model construction. We implement a local maxima detection to identify the tree tops, based on a ﬁxed-radius moving window in a Canopy Height Model (CHM) and images produced from UAS surveys. To compare the contribution of diﬀerent photogrammetric products, we analysed the local maxima detected from the CHM, from three image types (individual rectiﬁed and ortho-rectiﬁed images and ortho-mosaic) and from a combination of both CHM and images. The local maxima detection gave promising results, with low omission and true-positive rates of up to 89.2\%. A ﬁltering process of false positives was implemented, using a supervised classiﬁcation which decreased the false positives up to 2.6\%. Based on the local maxima combined with an area-based approach, we constructed models to assess top height (R2: 83\%, root mean square error [RMSE]: 5.7\%), number of stems (R2: 71\%, RMSE: 28.3\%), basal area (R2: 70\%, RMSE: 16.2\%), volume (R2: 69\%, RMSE: 20.1\%), and individual tree height (R2: 70\%, RMSE: 7.2\%). Despite a suboptimal data acquisition, our simple and ﬂexible method has yielded good results and shows great potential for application.},

	abstract = {Dead wood such as coarse dead wood debris (CWD) is an important component in natural forests since it increases the diversity of plants, fungi, and animals. It serves as habitat, provides nutrients and is conducive to forest regeneration, ecosystem stabilization and soil protection. In commercially operated forests, dead wood is often unwanted as it can act as an originator of calamities. Accordingly, efficient CWD monitoring approaches are needed. However, due to the small size of CWD objects satellite data-based approaches cannot be used to gather the needed information and conventional ground-based methods are expensive. Unmanned aerial systems (UAS) are becoming increasingly important in the forestry sector since structural and spectral features of forest stands can be extracted from the high geometric resolution data they produce. As such, they have great potential in supporting regular forest monitoring and inventory. Consequently, the potential of UAS imagery to map CWD is investigated in this study. The study area is located in the center of the Hainich National Park (HNP) in the federal state of Thuringia, Germany. The HNP features natural and unmanaged forest comprising deciduous tree species such as Fagus sylvatica (beech), Fraxinus excelsior (ash), Acer pseudoplatanus (sycamore maple), and Carpinus betulus (hornbeam). The flight campaign was controlled from the Hainich eddy covariance flux tower located at the Eastern edge of the test site. Red-green-blue (RGB) image data were captured in March 2019 during leaf-off conditions using off-the-shelf hardware. Agisoft Metashape Pro was used for the delineation of a three-dimensional (3D) point cloud, which formed the basis for creating a canopy-free RGB orthomosaic and mapping CWD. As heavily decomposed CWD hardly stands out from the ground due to its low height, it might not be detectable by means of 3D geometric information. For this reason, solely RGB data were used for the classification of CWD. The mapping task was accomplished using a line extraction approach developed within the object-based image analysis (OBIA) software eCognition. The achieved CWD detection accuracy can compete with results of studies utilizing high-density airborne light detection and ranging (LiDAR)-based point clouds. Out of 180 CWD objects, 135 objects were successfully delineated while 76 false alarms occurred. Although the developed OBIA approach only utilizes spectral information, it is important to understand that the 3D information extracted from our UAS data is a key requirement for successful CWD mapping as it provides the foundation for the canopy-free orthomosaic created in an earlier step. We conclude that UAS imagery is an alternative to laser data in particular if rapid update and quick response is required. We conclude that UAS imagery is an alternative to laser data for CWD mapping, especially when a rapid response and quick reaction, e.g., after a storm event, is required.},

	abstract = {The use of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) in vegetation remote sensing allows a time-flexible and cost-effective acquisition of very high-resolution imagery. Still, current methods for the mapping of forest tree species do not exploit the respective, rich spatial information. Here, we assessed the potential of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and very high-resolution RGB imagery from UAVs for the mapping of tree species in temperate forests. We used multicopter UAVs to obtain very high-resolution ({\textless}2 cm) RGB imagery over 51 ha of temperate forests in the Southern Black Forest region, and the Hainich National Park in Germany. To fully harness the end-to-end learning capabilities of CNNs, we used a semantic segmentation approach (U-net) that concurrently segments and classifies tree species from imagery. With a diverse dataset in terms of study areas, site conditions, illumination properties, and phenology, we accurately mapped nine tree species, three genus-level classes, deadwood, and forest floor (mean F1-score 0.73). A larger tile size during CNN training negatively affected the model accuracies for underrepresented classes. Additional height information from normalized digital surface models slightly increased the model accuracy but increased computational complexity and data requirements. A coarser spatial resolution substantially reduced the model accuracy (mean F1-score of 0.26 at 32 cm resolution). Our results highlight the key role that UAVs can play in the mapping of forest tree species, given that air- and spaceborne remote sensing currently does not provide comparable spatial resolutions. The end-to-end learning capability of CNNs makes extensive preprocessing partly obsolete. The use of large and diverse datasets facilitate a high degree of generalization of the CNN, thus fostering transferability. The synergy of high-resolution UAV imagery and CNN provide a fast and flexible yet accurate means of mapping forest tree species.},

	abstract = {Recent technical advances in drones make them increasingly relevant and important tools for forest measurements. However, information on how to optimally set ﬂight parameters and choose sensor resolution is lagging behind the technical developments. Our study aims to address this gap, exploring the effects of drone ﬂight parameters (altitude, image overlap, and sensor resolution) on image reconstruction and successful 3D point extraction. This study was conducted using video footage obtained from ﬂights at several altitudes, sampled for images at varying frequencies to obtain forward overlap ratios ranging between 91 and 99\%. Artiﬁcial reduction of image resolution was used to simulate sensor resolutions between 0.3 and 8.3 Megapixels (Mpx). The resulting data matrix was analysed using commercial multi-view reconstruction (MVG) software to understand the effects of drone variables on (1) reconstruction detail and precision, (2) ﬂight times of the drone, and (3) reconstruction times during data processing. The correlations between variables were statistically analysed with a multivariate generalised additive model (GAM), based on a tensor spline smoother to construct response surfaces. Flight time was linearly related to altitude, while processing time was mainly inﬂuenced by altitude and forward overlap, which in turn changed the number of images processed. Low ﬂight altitudes yielded the highest reconstruction details and best precision, particularly in combination with high image overlaps. Interestingly, this effect was nonlinear and not directly related to increased sensor resolution at higher altitudes. We suggest that image geometry and high image frequency enable the MVG algorithm to identify more points on the silhouettes of tree crowns. Our results are some of the ﬁrst estimates of reasonable value ranges for ﬂight parameter selection for forestry applications.},

This georeferencing accuracy of UAS orthomosaics is generally expressed as the checkpoint error. However, the checkpoint error alone gives no information about the reproducibility of the photogrammetrical compilation of orthomosaics. This study optimizes the geolocation of UAS orthomosaics time series and evaluates their reproducibility. A correlation analysis of repeatedly computed orthomosaics with identical parameters revealed a reproducibility of 99\% in a grassland and 75\% in a forest area. Between time steps, the corresponding positional errors of digitized objects lie between 0.07 m in the grassland and 0.3 m in the forest canopy.

	abstract = {Addressing global declines in biodiversity requires accurate assessments of key environmental attributes deter­ mining patterns of species diversity. Spatial heterogeneity of vegetation strongly affects species diversity pat­ terns, and measures of vegetation structure derived from lidar and satellite image texture analysis correlate well with species richness. Our goal here was to gain a better understanding of why image texture explains bird richness, by linking field-based measures of vegetation structure directly with both image texture and bird richness. In addition, we asked how image texture compares with lidar-based canopy height variability, and how sensor resolution affects the explanatory power of image texture. We generated texture metrics from 30 m (Landsat 8) and 10 m (Sentinel-2) resolution Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI) imagery from 2017 to 2019. We compared textures with vegetation metrics and bird richness data from 27 National Ecological Observatory Network (NEON) terrestrial field sites across the continental US. Both 30 and 10 m resolution texture metrics were strongly correlated with lidar-based canopy height variability ({\textbar}r{\textbar} = 0.64 and 0.80, respectively). Texture was moderately correlated with field-based metrics, including variability of vegetation height and tree stem diameter, and foliage height diversity (range {\textbar}r{\textbar} = 0.31–0.52). Generally, 10 m resolution texture had stronger correlations with lidar and field-based metrics than 30 m resolution texture. In univariate linear models of total bird richness, 10 m resolution texture metrics also had higher explanatory power (up to R2adj = 0.45), than 30 m texture metrics (up to R2adj = 0.31). Among all metrics evaluated, the 10 m homogeneity texture was the best univariate predictor of total bird richness. In multivariate bird richness models that combined texture with lidarbased canopy height variability and field-based metrics, both 30 m and 10 m resolution texture metrics were selected in top-ranked models and independently contributed explanatory power (up to R2adj = 46\%). Lidarbased canopy height variability was also selected in a top-ranked model of total bird richness, but indepen­ dently contributed only 15\% of the variance explained. Our results show satellite image texture characterized multiple features of structural and compositional vegetation heterogeneity, complemented more commonly used metrics in models of bird richness and for some guilds outperformed both lidar-based canopy height variability and field-based vegetation measurements. Ours is the first study to directly link image texture both to specific components of vegetation heterogeneity and to bird richness across multiple ecoregions and spatial resolutions, thereby shedding light on habitat features underlying the strong correlation between image texture and biodiversity.},

              Recent progress in remote sensing provides much-needed, large-scale spatio-temporal information on habitat structures important for biodiversity conservation. Here we examine the potential of a newly launched satellite-borne radar system (Sentinel-1) to map the biodiversity of twelve taxa across five temperate forest regions in central Europe. We show that the sensitivity of radar to habitat structure is similar to that of airborne laser scanning (ALS), the current gold standard in the measurement of forest structure. Our models of different facets of biodiversity reveal that radar performs as well as ALS; median
              R²
              over twelve taxa by ALS and radar are 0.51 and 0.57 respectively for the first non-metric multidimensional scaling axes representing assemblage composition. We further demonstrate the promising predictive ability of radar-derived data with external validation based on the species composition of birds and saproxylic beetles. Establishing new area-wide biodiversity monitoring by remote sensing will require the coupling of radar data to stratified and standardized collected local species data.},

	abstract = {The structural heterogeneity of vegetation is a key factor for explaining animal diversity patterns at a local scale. Improvements in airborne light detection and ranging (lidar) technologies have enabled researchers to study forest 3D structure with increasing accuracy. Most structure–animal diversity work has focused on structural metrics derived from lidar returns from canopy and terrain features. Here, we built new lidar structural metrics based on the Leaf Area Density (LAD) at each vegetation height layer, and used these metrics to study how different aspects of forest structural heterogeneity explain variation in bird species richness. Our goals were to test: (1) whether LAD-based metrics better explained bird species richness compared to metrics based on the top of the canopy; and (2) if different aspects of structural heterogeneity had diverse effects on bird richness. We used discrete lidar data together with 61 breeding landbird points provided by the National Ecological Observatory Network at ﬁve forest sites of the eastern US. We used the lidar metrics as predictors of bird species richness and analyzed the shape of the response curves against each predictor. Metrics based on LAD measurements had better explanatory power (43\% of variance explained) than those based on the variation of canopy heights (32\% of variance explained). Dividing the forest plots into smaller grids allowed us to study the within-plot horizontal variation of the vertical heterogeneity, as well as to analyze how the vegetation density is horizontally distributed at each height layer. Bird species richness increased with horizontal heterogeneity, while vertical heterogeneity had negative effects, contrary to previous research. The increasing capabilities of lidar will allow researchers to characterize forest structure with higher detail. Our ﬁndings highlight the need for structure–animal diversity studies to incorporate metrics that are able to capture different aspects of forest 3D heterogeneity.},

	abstract = {Forests provide important ecosystem services such as carbon sequestration. Forest landscapes are intrinsically heterogeneous—a problem for biomass and productivity assessment using remote sensing. Forest structure constitutes valuable additional information for the improved estimation of these variables. However, survey of forest structure by remote sensing remains a challenge which results mainly from the differences in forest structure metrics derived by using remote sensing compared to classical structural metrics from field data. To understand these differences, remote sensing measurements were linked with an individual-based forest model. Forest structure was analyzed by lidar remote sensing using metrics for the horizontal and vertical structures. To investigate the role of forest structure for biomass and productivity estimations in temperate forests, 25 lidar metrics of 375,000 simulated forest stands were analyzed. For the lidar-based metrics, top-of-canopy height arose as the best predictor for describing horizontal forest structure. The standard deviation of the vertical foliage profile was the best predictor for the vertical heterogeneity of a forest. Forest structure was also an important factor for the determination of forest biomass and aboveground wood productivity. In particular, horizontal structure was essential for forest biomass estimation. Predicting aboveground wood productivity must take into account both horizontal and vertical structures. In a case study based on these findings, forest structure, biomass and aboveground wood productivity are mapped for whole of Germany. The dominant type of forest in Germany is dense but less vertically structured forest stands. The total biomass of all German forests is 2.3 Gt, and the total aboveground woody productivity is 43 Mt/year. Future remote sensing missions will have the capability to provide information on forest structure (e.g., from lidar or radar). This will lead to more accurate assessments of forest biomass and productivity. These estimations can be used to evaluate forest ecosystems related to climate regulation and biodiversity protection.},

	abstract = {Eﬀective biodiversity management in forest ecosystems relies on the assessment of environmental indicators (surrogates) when attempting to measure total biodiversity. Bird species (BS) richness and micro-habitat (MH) diversity are two key features that are easily measured and can be utilized as biodiversity surrogates. Remote sensing technologies may be employed as a cost-eﬃcient measure as well as accurately mapping diversity features across broad geographical areas. This study examined the possibilities of predicting BS richness and MH diversity using variables derived from satellite data in a brutian pine (Pinus brutia Ten.) forest ecosystem located in the Southwestern Mediterranean Region of Turkey. The study utilized 40 (90 × 90 m, 0.81 ha) sample plots. We used ﬁrst, and second-order image texture measures calculated from RapidEye, SPOT-5 and Aster Normalized Diﬀerence Vegetation Index (NDVI) as explanatory variables for predicting these biodiversity surrogates at alpha (α) level. Stepwise linear regression analyses showed that BS richness and MH diversity can be estimated using image texture measures. According to the cross-validation test; BS richness was best predicted using standard deviation of Gray levels (STD) and Gray-Level Co-Occurrence Matrix (GLCM) Homogeneity of RapidEye NDVI (RCV2 = 0.73, STECV = 4.321), while MH diversity was best predicted using STD and GLCM Correlation of SPOT NDVI (RCV2 = 0.73, STECV = 0.148). In conclusion, the satellite-based diversity maps produced in this study can provide valuable data for forest managers and assist in formulating adaptive management plans for the ecologically sustainable management of brutian pine forest ecosystems.},

For many species, especially those living in remote areas, we currently lack this information. Time and ﬁnancial resources to analyze habitat use are limited. We aimed to develop a method to describe habitat preferences based on a combination of bird surveys with remotely sensed ﬁne-scale land cover maps. We created a blended multiband remote sensing product from SPOT 6 and Landsat 8 data with a high spatial resolution. We surveyed populations of three bird species (Yellow-breasted Bunting Emberiza aureola, Ochre-rumped Bunting Emberiza yessoensis, and Black-faced Bunting Emberiza spodocephala) at a study site in the Russian Far East using hierarchical distance sampling, a survey method that allows to correct for varying detection probability. Combining the bird survey data and land cover variables from the remote sensing product allowed us to model population density as a function of environmental variables. We found that even small-scale land cover characteristics were predictable using remote sensing data with suﬃcient accuracy. The overall classiﬁcation accuracy with pansharpened SPOT 6 data alone amounted to 71.3\%. Higher accuracies were reached via the additional integration of SWIR bands (overall accuracy = 73.21\%), especially for complex small-scale land cover types such as shrubby areas. This helped to reach a high accuracy in the habitat models. Abundances of the three studied bird species were closely linked to the proportion of wetland, willow shrubs, and habitat heterogeneity. Habitat requirements and population sizes of species of interest are valuable information for stakeholders and decision-makers to maximize the potential success of habitat management measures.},
