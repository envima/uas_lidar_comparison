# Pointcloud preprocessing

1. UAS Denseclouds had variying absolute height values
    - Stems from the photogrammetric process itself
    - has to be investigated at some point

2. Filtered Denseclouds by removing low confidence values
    - confidence value corresponds to the number of depth maps the point appears in
    - Low values - low amount of depth maps
    - Used a threshold of 3 to filter the denseclouds
    - [deep3d.co.uk/2020/05/10/confidence-is-everything](https://deep3d.co.uk/2020/05/10/confidence-is-everything/)

3. Normalized heights with the LiDAR based DEM
    - also for the UAS clouds
    - Terrain should not differ
    - it is reasonable to assume that there is a 1x1 m terrain model available
